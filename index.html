                    <h3> Travelling</h3>
                    <p>By far one of my favourite hobbies (and the most expensive), but also so rewarding. Having spent summers in Germany growing up, my love for traveling and experiencing new places and cultures started at a young age.</p>

                    <h3>Staying Active</h3>
                    <p>I grew up as a dancer, I spent my winters on the slopes with my siblings and friends on our boards, and transitioned into rep soccer in the summers. I still love being active just as much now, as I did back then. </p>
